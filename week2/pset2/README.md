## Base Value

In the context of the Caesar cipher, the base value refers to the starting point within the alphabet. Since letters in the alphabet are ordered from A to Z (and a to z), we need a reference point when shifting letters by a certain amount. For uppercase letters, the base value is 'A', and for lowercase letters, the base value is 'a'. The base value allows us to establish a reference point for calculating the position of letters within the alphabet.

## Offset

The offset represents the distance by which letters are moved from their base value. In the Caesar cipher, the key determines how many positions each letter should be shifted. When encrypting, we calculate the offset to determine the new position of each letter. Since the Caesar cipher involves circular shifting of letters (looping around the alphabet), the offset ensures that letters beyond the end of the alphabet wrap around to the beginning. For example, with a key of 3, 'Z' becomes 'C'.
