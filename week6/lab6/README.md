### Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:<br>

When the number of simulations is less than 1,000, the outcomes observed through multiple<br>
simulations are noticely inconsistent with the team that actually wins the championship.<br>
Even when increasing the number of simulations, the championship team does not exhibit<br>
stability, indicating a significant element of randomness.<br>

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.<br>
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:<br>
Taking into account both the cost and the similarity, I personally believe that around 10,000<br>
simulations can provide some guiding insight.<br>
