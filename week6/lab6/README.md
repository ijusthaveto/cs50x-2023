### Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

When the number of simulations is less than 1,000, the outcomes observed through multiple
simulations are noticely inconsistent with the team that actually wins the championship.
Even when increasing the number of simulations, the championship team does not exhibit
stability, indicating a significant element of randomness.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Taking into account both the cost and the similarity, I personally believe that around 10,000
simulations can provide some guiding insight.
