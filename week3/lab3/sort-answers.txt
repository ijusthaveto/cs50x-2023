sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: When the test data itself is ordered, sorting algorithm 1 is the fastest, while

when the test data is in reverse order, sorting algorithm 1 is much solwer. This undoubtedly aligns

with the characteristics of bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: When testing the three algorithm with randomly ordered test data, the performance

of algorithm 2 is noticeably superior to the other two algorithms, especially when the data size

reaches 5000.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The answer obtained by process of elimination, of course, shows that when facing a

random dataset, its running speed is, on average, in the middle among the three.
